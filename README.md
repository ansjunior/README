### Hello, Im glad you came! =D

Studying IT as my second college degree, in the actual time Im working with big data, as intern, at Kumulus.
I persuit challenges since I was young and I discovered that, in the IT career, I would be filled with challenges every day, making my passion for it just grown.

One of my main goals is to use technology to help the world to become a better and more equal place to live.ðŸŒŽ

I'm also tech enthusiast and amateur astronomer (looking forward to, one day, help tech companies go out space).ðŸš€
